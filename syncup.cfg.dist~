# ==== Path Configuration ====
#
# Trailing slashes are optional for all paths.
#
# For each path mapping "pm" defined in path_mappings, pytograph will:
#
#   1) Monitor the following folder for changes: <local_root_path>/<pm.local>
#   2) Reflect those changes in the following remote folder: <remote_root_path>/<pm.remote>
#

# Top level directory location on the remote server; should be an absolute path *without tilde notation*
# (should start with a leading slash.)
# Should use UNIX-style forward slashes, since the remote server will be accessed via SFTP.
remote_root_path: '/home/amit/argo'

# Top level directory location on the local machine. Should be an absolute path. Tilde notation is acceptable.
local_root_path: '~/codes/loc1'

# A list of relative path mappings (local path => remote path.)
# Each local path should be located relative to and underneath the <local_root_path> defined above.
# Each remote path will be manipulated relative to and underneath the <remote_root_path> defined above,
# and should use forward slashes.
# No path appearing below should contain leading slashes.
path_mappings:
[
  { local: '', remote: '' }, # Would map <local_root_path> => <remote_root_path>
  { local: '', remote: '' }, # Would map <local_root_path> => <remote_root_path>
]
